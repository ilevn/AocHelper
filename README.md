# AocHelper

AocHelper is a small template project that helps you with setting up your ideal Java environment
for all Advent of Code puzzles.

It provides functionality for automatically fetching puzzle input and helps with parsing it.

## Getting started

In order to get started, simply create a `config.properties` file at the project root with `secret=your session cookie`.  
The session cookie can be obtained by visiting [Advent Of Code]("https://adventofcode.com/") and copying
it from the network tab of your preferred browser.  

A sample solution for the (non-existent) day 0 can be found at `src/main/java/year2020/Day0.java`.
